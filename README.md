# ToDo-List-Groovy
Test for Pablo Gil.

# Installation 
The project runs on JVM 11.0.24, Grails 5.1.9 and Gradle 6.8.3
The recommended process is using SDKMAN or homebrew (I'm using MacOS):

- sdk install grails 5.1.9 

- sdk install gradle 6.8.3 

Set these versions as default, then execute the application with these commands:

- gradle clean build (if installed globally)

- grails dev run-app.

If it brings too much trouble installing I can email the whole project or remove the gitignore and push my files.
